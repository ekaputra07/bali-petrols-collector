# bali-petrols-collector

This app is the first app that I developed for my current pet project called Bali Petrols, which is a simple app that track your current location and display nearest petrol stations around the area especially in Bali - Indonesia.

The project itself will consist of 2 apps, this app which I'll use to collect petrol station GPS coordinates, and the second one is the app for the user which I will start to develop as soon after all basic features of this app finished.

Here's the screenshots:
